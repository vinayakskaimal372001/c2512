### 1ï¸âƒ£ Header Files

```cpp
#include <QCoreApplication>
#include <QThread>
#include <QThreadPool>
#include <QRunnable>
#include <QDebug>
#include <QElapsedTimer>
```
- `#include <QCoreApplication>` â†’ Required to create a **Qt console application**. This manages event loops and application lifetime.  
- `#include <QThread>` â†’ Provides a way to manage separate threads of execution.  
- `#include <QThreadPool>` â†’ Manages a pool of worker threads for efficient parallel execution.  
- `#include <QRunnable>` â†’ Used to create lightweight, reusable tasks that can be run by `QThreadPool`.  
- `#include <QDebug>` â†’ Provides logging utilities to print debugging messages.  
- `#include <QElapsedTimer>` â†’ Measures elapsed time between two points for performance comparison.

### 2ï¸âƒ£ Defining `WorkerThread` using `QThread` (Explicit Thread Management)

```cpp
class WorkerThread : public QThread {
protected:
    void run() override {
        qDebug() << "QThread running on thread:" << QThread::currentThread();
        QThread::sleep(2);  // Simulating a long-running task
    }
};
```
- This class **inherits** from `QThread`, making it an independent thread.  
- **`run()`** is overridden:
  - `qDebug() << "QThread running on thread:" << QThread::currentThread();`
    - Prints the thread ID to confirm that it's running on a separate thread.
  - `QThread::sleep(2);`
    - Simulates a long-running task by pausing for **2 seconds**.
- When `start()` is called on an instance of `WorkerThread`, the `run()` method executes **in a separate thread**.  

---

### 3ï¸âƒ£ Defining `TaskRunner` using `QRunnable` (Thread Pool Execution)

```cpp
class TaskRunner : public QRunnable {
public:
    void run() override {
        qDebug() << "QRunnable running on thread:" << QThread::currentThread();
        QThread::sleep(2);  // Simulating a long-running task
    }
};
```
- This class **inherits** from `QRunnable`, which is designed for lightweight, re-usable tasks.  
- **`run()`** is overridden:
  - `qDebug() << "QRunnable running on thread:" << QThread::currentThread();`
    - Prints the thread ID to verify that it runs inside `QThreadPool`.
  - `QThread::sleep(2);`
    - Simulates a long-running task (same as `QThread`).  
- This **does not** use `start()`. Instead, it is submitted to `QThreadPool`, which automatically assigns it to an available thread.  

---

### 4ï¸âƒ£ `main()` Function - Execution Flow

```cpp
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    QCoreApplication app(argc, argv);
```
- Initializes the Qt **event loop** and application.  
- Required for `QThreadPool` and `QRunnable` to function correctly.  

---

### 5ï¸âƒ£ Measuring Execution Time for `QThread`

```cpp
    QElapsedTimer timer;
    timer.start();
```
- **`QElapsedTimer`** is used to measure how long each approach takes.  
- `timer.start();` begins the timer before executing the threads.  

#### Creating and Running `WorkerThread` Instances
```cpp
    WorkerThread *thread1 = new WorkerThread();
    WorkerThread *thread2 = new WorkerThread();

    thread1->start();
    thread2->start();
```
- **Creates two worker threads** (`thread1`, `thread2`).  
- **Calls `start()`**, which internally calls `run()` on separate threads.  

#### Waiting for Threads to Complete
```cpp
    thread1->wait();
    thread2->wait();
```
- **Blocks** the main thread until both `thread1` and `thread2` **finish execution**.  
- Ensures that `QThread` execution completes before moving forward.  

#### Cleaning Up Memory
```cpp
    delete thread1;
    delete thread2;
```
- Since `WorkerThread` objects were created with `new`, they **must be deleted** manually.  
- Prevents memory leaks.  

#### Logging Execution Time
```cpp
    qDebug() << "QThread Execution Time:" << timer.elapsed() << "ms";
```
- **Prints the time taken** by `QThread` execution in milliseconds.  

---

### 6ï¸âƒ£ Measuring Execution Time for `QThreadPool`

```cpp
    timer.restart();
```
- Resets the timer before starting `QThreadPool` execution.  

#### Using `QThreadPool` for Parallel Execution
```cpp
    QThreadPool *pool = QThreadPool::globalInstance();
```
- **`QThreadPool::globalInstance()`** returns a shared thread pool instance.  
- Manages multiple background tasks efficiently.  

#### Creating and Submitting Tasks
```cpp
    TaskRunner *task1 = new TaskRunner();
    TaskRunner *task2 = new TaskRunner();

    pool->start(task1);
    pool->start(task2);
```
- Creates two `TaskRunner` objects.  
- Submits them to `QThreadPool`, which automatically assigns them to available threads.  

#### Waiting for `QThreadPool` to Complete
```cpp
    pool->waitForDone();
```
- **Blocks** execution until all submitted tasks **finish execution**.  
- Ensures `QThreadPool` tasks complete before moving forward.  

#### Logging Execution Time
```cpp
    qDebug() << "QThreadPool Execution Time:" << timer.elapsed() << "ms";
```
- **Prints the execution time** taken by `QThreadPool`.

### ðŸ”¹ Program Flow Summary
1ï¸âƒ£ **Application Starts**  
- `QCoreApplication` initializes the Qt event loop.  

2ï¸âƒ£ **QThread Execution**  
- Two `WorkerThread` instances are created and started.  
- They execute **on separate threads** and take **~2 seconds**.  
- The `main()` thread waits for them to finish before continuing.  
- Execution time is logged.  

3ï¸âƒ£ **QThreadPool Execution**  
- Two `TaskRunner` instances are submitted to `QThreadPool`.  
- `QThreadPool` assigns them to available threads.  
- The `main()` thread waits for all tasks to finish.  
- Execution time is logged.  

4ï¸âƒ£ **Program Ends**

### ðŸ”¹ Comparison: QThread vs. QThreadPool
| Feature          | `QThread`                          | `QThreadPool`                       |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Thread Management** | Explicit (`start()`, `wait()`, `delete`) | Managed automatically |
| **Overhead**    | High (each thread is separate) | Low (threads are reused) |
| **Best for**    | Long-running tasks, event loops | Short, parallel tasks |
| **Memory Usage** | Higher (new thread for each task) | Lower (reuses existing threads) |

### âœ… Key Takeaways
- **Use `QThread` when**:
  - You need a **dedicated** thread for long-running operations.
  - You need an **event loop** in the thread (e.g., handling signals/slots).
  
- **Use `QThreadPool` when**:
  - You need to execute **many short-lived tasks** efficiently.
  - You want to **reuse** threads without creating/destroying them.
